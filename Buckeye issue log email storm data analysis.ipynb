It is not straightforward how to split the real email body from the rest of the text that may (or may noy) include a signature and previous answers. I have decided to consider everything before the first *From* or *Van* as the email body. This works but overestimates the letter count since it includes the signature (not always present).\n",
    "- The <b>Angriness</b> has been defined as the ratio between capital letters and the total amount of letters. It would be nice to extend/improve this definition using info from the email body such as the font size and color but unfortunately this info appears to be not easily accessible with the win32 client I used to parse the raw data.\n",
